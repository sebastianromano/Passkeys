# Support for Passkeys :key:
## **A website that can show which websites and apps utilizes Passkeys**

## What is Passkeys?

Passkeys is an authentication method that allows users to log in to online services without having to use a password.

## What about this website / repo?

This repository contains a list of websites and apps that support Passkeys. Simple as that.

## Why this?

- **Information availability**:
    - This website can be used to search for websites and apps that support Passkeys and thus, making it easy and convenient to either switch or gain information on which services that offer this authentication method.

## And why not that?

This project does not aim to be a complete database of every service out there supporting Passkeys. That would be terrific, but ultimately unrealistic.

Rather, the project's goal is to provide a simple and easy to use website that can be used to search for services that support Passkeys *in the transition period to a more secure and convenient authentication method*.

**Status**: *In Development*

This project is currently in development and is not yet available on a separate website.

If you would like to contribute to this project, please don't hesitate to contact me!

## But how can I help?

You can contribute by adding a website or app that supports Passkeys, either by creating a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) or an [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).
